        <h1>Eve's Apple</h1>
        <p>In the early hours, before dawn's first light,<br>
           There wandered a seeker, lost to the night.<br>
           Eyes wide with wonder, heart heavy with quests,<br>
           In search of answers, in pursuit of what's best.</p>

        <p>Through forests of questions and valleys of doubt,<br>
           The seeker kept moving, inside and out.<br>
           Then, in the darkness, a beacon shone bright,<br>
           God's searchlights finding her, in the depths of the night.</p>

        <!-- Include more paragraphs as needed -->

        <p>This journey of hers, a testament, a song,<br>
           Of a love so deep, a call so strong.<br>
           At the foot of Eden's Tree, where it all begins,<br>
           She finds her strength, and with God, she wins.</p>
